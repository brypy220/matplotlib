Matplotlib
====================


This project utilizes:

- historgrams
- line graphs
- scatter plots
- bar graphs
- plotting from Pandas Dataframes
- pyplot
- seaborn
- customizing plots



- when I first made this file `misc` was still being used instead of `datasets` and there was no dependency on `pooch`,another reason I love the industry because there is always something to learn.





Throughout the code there are various comments for my own personal use
